Hello :)

This is some kind of Sample Portfolio, I hope to have a similar one very soon :)

I'm still learning JavaScript, this mini-project I found on Free Code Camp YouTube channel,
done by codeSTACKr, and it was interesting to me, so I did it

Of course, I changed some things how I liked, such as making project links
immediately visible on smaller screens, since there is no hover effect on mobile devices

Also, I done it with SASS, it is fun way to do CSS

Any advice is wellcome :)
